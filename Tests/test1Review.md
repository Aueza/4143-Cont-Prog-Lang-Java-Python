## History
**Programming Lang Definition:**  Systematic notation by which we describe computational processes to others.

**John Von Neumann:**  Proposed that computers should be permanently hardwired with a small set of general-purpose operations.

**Machine Language:**  A series of binary coded to organize the basic hardware operations to solve more specific problems. Operators could flip switches to enter these codes, called machine language, into memory.

**Assembly Language:**  Set of mnemonic symbols for instruction codes and memory locations (EX: LD R1, FIRST).

**High-Level language:**  Uses syntax and wording very similar to human languages to make them more readable and understandable for programmers.

**Fortran:**  FORmula TRANslation language.
- Developed by John Backus in the 1950s.
- Reflected the architecture of a particular type of machine.
- Lacked the structured control statements and data structure of later high-level languages.
  
Popular with scientists and engineers for its support for algebraic notation and floating-point numbers.

**Algol:**  ALGOrithmic language released in 1960. 
- Introduced structured control statements for sequencing, loops, and conditionals.
- Supported different numeric types.
- Introduced the array structure.
- Supported procedures, including recursive procedures.
- The requirement for an ALGOL compiler was also introduced.

**Compiler:**  Translates programming language statements into machine code.

**Ada:**  Used by the U.S. Department of Defense for embedding applications.
