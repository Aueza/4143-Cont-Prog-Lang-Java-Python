## History
**Programming Lang Definition:**  Systematic notation by which we describe computational processes to others.

**John Von Neumann:**  Proposed that computers should be permanently hardwired with a small set of general-purpose operations.

**Machine Language:**  A series of binary coded to organize the basic hardware operations to solve more specific problems. Operators could flip switches to enter these codes, called machine language, into memory.

**Assembly Language:**  Set of mnemonic symbols for instruction codes and memory locations (EX: LD R1, FIRST).

**High-Level language:**  Uses syntax and wording very similar to human languages to make them more readable and understandable for programmers.

**Fortran:**  FORmula TRANslation language.
