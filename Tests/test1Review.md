## History
**Programming Lang Definition:** Systematic notation by which we describe computational processes to others.
**John Von Neumann:** Proposed that computers should be permanently hardwired with a small set of general-purpose operations.
**Machine Language:** A series of binary coded to organize the basic hardware operations to solve more specific problems. Operators could flip switches to enter these codes, called machine language, into memory.
